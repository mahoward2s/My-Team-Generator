## Description
As a manager I wanted to have the ability to create a workflow for my different project teams.   I want easy access to each team member's name, id, and email.   However, depending on their position I would like additional information.  If they are a manager I would like to know their office number.  If they are an engineer on the team I would like to have access to their github.  If they are an intern I would like to know what school they are currently attending.  

With this generator I am able to create teams and work flows that make it easy to navigate to each employee.

## Installation
Link to website:

## Usage 
The application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.
